# Common Assets

Place shared resources here so both apps (dock + overlay) and potential future utilities can reference them without duplication.

## Suggested Structure

- `common/fonts/` – Custom font files (e.g., `Inter-Variable.woff2`).
- `common/styles/` – CSS tokens, mixins, reset.
- `common/scripts/` – Utilities such as markdown renderer initialization or BroadcastChannel wrappers.

Document every addition inside this README (source, license) to keep the project audit-friendly.
